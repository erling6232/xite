XITE on the World Wide Web

   There is a World Wide Web home page for XITE. You can reach it with a
   program such as Opera, Netscape, Lynx or Internet Explorer, using the
   URL http://www.ifi.uio.no/~blab/Software/Xite.
   
XITE on anonymous ftp

   XITE is available with anonymous ftp from ftp.ifi.uio.no in
   /pub/blab/xite. Remember to use binary transfer mode for the files
   with extension Z, gz, zip or dll.
   
XITE dependencies

     * For the display programs:
          + The X Window System, Version 11, Release 5 or higher.
          + A PseudoColor or GrayScale 8-plane, or DirectColor or
            TrueColor 24-plane visual. PseudoColor or DirectColor is
            preferable.
     * For conversion between XITE BIFF image files and TIFF files: An
       ANSI C compiler, like GNU gcc, and the libtiff TIFF library. You
       can get the library from ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff.
     * For conversion between XITE BIFF image files and pbm/pgm/ppm/pnm
       files: The Netpbm or Pbmplus library. You can get the libraries
       from http://www.funet.fi/pub/graphics/packages/pbmplus/.
     * For conversion between XITE BIFF image files and MATLAB MAT-files:
       MATLAB. You can get MATLAB from http://www.mathworks.com/.
     * For the prebuilt Windows NT/95 distribution: The Microsoft Visual
       C dynamic link runtime library. If this is not already installed
       on your system, it is available from the XITE ftp directory as the
       file msvcrt.dll.
     * For reading the System Administrator's and the User's Manual:
          + PostScript viewer/printer or PDF reader (e.g. acroread from
            Adobe).
          + Most of the documentation is also available html-coded on the
            XITE WWW home page and can be read with a WWW browser.
       
Files

   Most of these files are also contained in xite.tar.gz (and
   xite.tar.Z). They can be found in the etc and etc/.install directories
   below the XITE home directory after installation.
