Description: X-based Image processing Tools and Environment
 XITE consists of display programs with image widget and graphical user
 interface as well as more than 200 command line programs and 600 subroutines,
 all documented on-line. XITE uses its own image file format (BIFF), but
 comes with converters between BIFF and TIFF, pnm, sunraster, raw, MATLAB and
 ascii.
 .
 The command line programs and subroutine library are written in C and run
 under UNIX, Windows NT and Windows 95.
 .
 The display programs run under UNIX. They work with images of arbitrary size
 and pixel type on 8-bit PseudoColor and 24-bit DirectColor and TrueColor X11
 displays. Images can be zoomed and panned, and colortables can be selected
 from a menu. The main display program, xshow, gives access to most of the
 other command line programs via a menu interface which the user can customize
 and extend to include local programs. Input images for the menu entries
 can be selected with the mouse, and output images appear on the display.
 .
 The available programs include operations such as statistics, merging,
 resampling, arithmetic/logical/relational operations, rotation, mirroring,
 affine transformations, convolution, filter design, Fourier/Hartley/Haar/Hough
 transforms, color manipulation, histogram transformations, global and
 local thresholding, binary thinning, edge detection, morphological operations,
 classification, image analysis and texture estimation.
 .
 A toolkit is supplied to simplify development of X11 based applications.
