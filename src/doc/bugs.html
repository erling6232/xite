<h1> Known bugs in XITE </h1>

<h2> Known bugs in version 3.4 </h2>

<ul>
  <li> Some algorithms only work for images with pixel type
       <code>UNS_BYTE</code>.
  <li> Choosing <code>send image</code> from the histogram window works
       properly only for <code>UNS_BYTE</code> images.
  <li> Manipulation of the histogram is not reflected in the image when
       the histogram is made via the xshow menu on platforms with multiple
       hardware colormaps (such as Silicon Graphics Indy). This is not
       serious, since a histogram can also be generated from using the
       mouse button (Shift-MB2) in the image window. In this latter case,
       manipulation of the histogram is reflected.
  <li> The scrollbars in the slice window do not influence each other
       when the application is run on a Silicon Graphics Indy.
  <li> When a very narrow image is displayed, the actual image may only
       occupy a vertical strip on the left side of the window. The rest of
       the window will be shown in the window background color (typically
       gray). This happens when the following conditions are met.
       <ul>
	 <li> The window width is smaller than the width of the window
	      manager decoration (window title above the image).
	 <li> The window is displayed with fixed aspect ratio.
       </ul>
       To solve this, either start <strong>xshow</strong> with the option
       "-aspect" (to use variable aspect ratio) or turn off the fixed aspect
       ratio of the particular window as soon as it has come up (via a
       menu entry in the Options image menu), or remove the window manager
       decoration (see the manual page for your choice of window manager
       or look for a decoration resource in the window manager's application
       defaults file).
  <li> If you have problems building shared libraries on an IRIX64 host,
       add the option <code>-check_registry /usr/lib/so_locations</code> to
       the <code>ld</code> command. You can do it in the makefile for the
       IRIX64 platform (in XITE's <code>etc</code> directory) or with these
       steps:
       <pre>
       cd $XITE_HOME/src/Image
       make -r dso DSO_NAME_OPT='-check_registry /usr/lib64/so_locations -soname'
       </pre>
       If XITE was compiled in platform-dependent subdirectories, replace the
       above <code>cd</code> command with the following
       <pre>
       cd $XITE_HOME/src/Image/IRIX64
       </pre>
</ul>
