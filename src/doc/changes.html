<HR>

<H3><a NAME="v3.4_main-features">Main new features</A></H3>

<UL>
  <LI> The non-visual programs run under Windows NT version 4 and Windows 95.
       The routine library of non-visual functions is also available.<P>

       Differences between the NT/95 version and the Unix versions:
       <UL>
	 <LI> The notation for specifying a subset of bands when reading
              from a BIFF file uses ";" as band specification separator under
              Windows NT/95 (and ":" under UNIX).
	 <LI> <EM>cdoc</EM> can not make symbolic links under NT/95 while
	      producing reference documentation. Files are copied instead.
	 <LI> <EM>colorquant</EM> has no timing support under NT/95.
         <LI> For tilde ("~") expansion of path-names, the environment
              variable <VAR>HOMEPATH</VAR> is checked under Windows NT/95 if
              the environment variable <VAR>HOME</VAR> is not set. The password
              database is not used.
       </UL>

       <P>
       Also note that the <KBD>-man</KBD> and <KBD>-whatis</KBD> options
       work under Windows NT/95.
</UL>

<H3><a NAME="v3.4_incompatibilities">Version incompatibilities</A></H3>

This version is compatible with the previous version, except for the
arguments of the function <EM>scatter</EM>.

<H3><a NAME="v3.4_installation">Installation</A></H3>

<UL>
  <LI> Dynamic shared libraries (dynamic-link libraries on Windows NT/95) are
       created by default for some platforms.
       This, in addition to other compilation changes, greatly reduces
       required disk space for the executable binaries. Typically only
       one sixth of the space is needed.
  <LI> MATLAB- and TIFF-dependent functions are put in separate libraries.
  <LI> Removed all dependencies on <EM>csh</EM>.
  <LI> Adapted for Windows NT/95, when installation is run under UNIX.
       Compilation and linking must of course be run under NT, but makefiles
       etc can be created under UNIX.
  <LI> Separate installation for precompiled NT/95 distribution.
</UL>

<H3><a NAME="v3.4_documentation">Documentation</A></H3>

Updated manuals for NT/95. Various other updates and extensions to the
reference manual.

<H3><a NAME="v3.4_new-non-visual">New non-visual programs</A></H3>

<H4>mkMorph</H4>

<EM>mkMorph</EM> can be used to create a structuring element for
morphological operations. It is included in the menu hierarchy for
<EM>xshow</EM>.

<H3><a NAME="v3.4_fix-visual">
New features and bug fixes for X based visual programs</A></H3>

<H4>All programs</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> Fixed bug which made histograms and cumulative histograms of very
       large images get a very coarse appearance (a quantization of
       the correct curves). The maximum histogram value now touches the top
       of the display area.
  <LI> The Image Information entry in the Tools menu of the <EM>Image</EM>
       Widget works also for images with pixel type complex and double complex.
  <LI> Zooming in on a complex-valued image will show the numerical pixel
       values.
  <LI> Fixed floating exception error on Dec alpha and Linux.
  <LI> Avoiding some unnecessary resizing and exposure calls.
  <LI> The histogram and slice tools in the <EM>Image</EM> widget don't crash
       on complex-valued images.
</UL>

argument. The functionality is provided by <EM>xshow</EM> and various
command-line based histogram programs.

<H4>xshow</H4>

<UL>
  <LI> Reading/copying a subset of bands from a memory-intensive image is
       much more efficient, using only the memory necessary for the requested
       bands.
  <LI> The control widget will display pixel values also for complex-valued
       images.
  <LI> Added <EM>mkMorph</EM> to menu hierarchy.
  <LI> Removed <EM>image_minmax</EM> from menu hierarchy. <EM>statistics</EM>
       covers this functionality.
  <LI> Fixed the macro function for the case when no menu-file could be
       edited (no private file and no writable public file). Expanding tilde
       in menu-file names.
</UL>

<H3><a NAME="v3.4_fix-non-visual">
New features and bug fixes for non-visual programs</A></H3>

<H4>All programs</H4>

Using the environment variable MESSAGEPROG now works. Did it ever work?
The environment variable can now also take options and arguments.

<H4>biff2matlab, matlab2biff, loadBiff, saveBiff</H4>

Converted to MATLAB 5.1.

<H4>biff2sunraster</H4>

<UL>
  <LI> Accepts three-band rgb images, converting to 24-bit Sun rasterfiles.
  <LI> Accepts standard XITE filenames ("-", "-0", "-1").
</UL>

<H4>biffcopy</H4>

Extracting a subset of bands from a memory-intensive image is
much more efficient, using only the memory necessary for the requested
bands.

<UL>
  <LI> Will handle more than one stdin input argument.
  <LI> Will handle band specification also when appended to stdin input
       argument.
  <LI> Band specification on file name can be mixed with option <KBD>-n</KBD>.
  <LI> Options can not any longer be grouped, they must be space separated.
</UL>

<H4>glRunLength</H4>

<UL>
  <LI> Fixed bug which required exactly two command-line arguments in addition
       to options.
  <LI> Improved output appearance.
</UL>

<H4>glcm</H4>

<UL>
  <LI> Initialized output band (GLCM matrix) properly to zeros, to avoid
       uninitialized output pixels for input pixel values greater than
       <SAMP>num_greylevels</SAMP>.
  <LI> Avoid processing remaining bands only if there is a real error
       condition in <EM>glcm()</EM>, not for a warning condition.
</UL>

<H4>glcmParameter</H4>

<UL>
  <LI> Avoids scaling error when the GLCM matrix contains only zeros.
  <LI> Initializing the GLCM matrix if the <KBD>-mkglcm</KBD> option is used.
</UL>

<H4>houghCircle</H4>

Function <EM>drawCircle()</EM> made public.

<H4>houghLine</H4>

<UL>
  <LI> Function <EM>drawLine()</EM> made public.
  <LI> Giving special treatment to the case of theta=90 degrees.
</UL>

<H4>imag</H4>

is double.

<H4>morphDilate</H4>

Fixed bug in calculating maximum values.

<H4>scatter</H4>

Function <EM>scatter()</EM> requires an additional argument.

<H4>statistics</H4>

<UL>
  <LI> Can also handle complex-valued images (added function
       <EM>cstatistic()</EM>).
  <LI> Fixed the calculation of mean value for unsigned byte images to avoid
       integer overflow (and thus negative mean).
  <LI> Fixed the calculation of minimum and maximum value when only these
       two parameters were requested in the call to the <EM>statistic()</EM>
       function.
  <LI> Options can not any longer be grouped, they must be space separated.
</UL>

<H4>sunraster2biff</H4>

<UL>
  <LI> Handles images with odd width correctly.
  <LI> Handles 24-bit BGR and RGB as well as 32-bit XBGR and XRGB rasterfiles,
       all converted to three-band rgb BIFF images.
  <LI> Handles depth-1 rasterfiles correctly.
  <LI> Accepts old-format Sun rasterfiles.
  <LI> Accepts standard XITE filenames ("-", "-0", "-1").

       <EM>Iparse_band_spec</EM>, <EM>Ifilename_part</EM>,
       <EM>Iparse_filename</EM>, <EM>IpixPrintFormat</EM>.
  <LI> Improved the handling of input pipes.
  <LI> Using ";" as band specification separator under Windows NT/95.
  <LI> <EM>Iopen_image</EM> can now handle file names with band specification
       appended.
</UL>

<H4>ximage toolkit</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> The <EM>ximageInit</EM> function now processes both the standard
       <EM>ximage</EM> application resources and those described by the
       resources argument (instead of processing only the latter when they
       are supplied). The options table argument should be the
       concatenation of options tables for standard ximage options and
       any new options corresponding to the additional application resources.
  <LI> Added functions <EM>ximage_app_resources()</EM> and
       <EM>ximage_app_options()</EM>.
  <LI> Applications written without accompanying X resource files get
       reasonable appearances.
  <LI> Label widgets can now be from the Xaw or Xfwf widget set.
</UL>

<H4>cxite compilation/linking tool</H4>

<UL>
  <LI> Added option <KBD>-R</KBD>.
  <LI> Added platform-dependent compile- and link-flags. This takes care
       of using whatever definitions and libraries XITE is built with when
       you build your own XITE-dependent application. An example is to
       use Unix BSD definitions and libraries under SunOS5.

<HR>

<H3><a NAME="v3.3_incompatibilities">Version incompatibilities</A></H3>

This version is compatible with the previous version.

<H3><a NAME="v3.3_documentation">Documentation</A></H3>

A number of new man pages are available, e.g. for the <EM>Image</EM> and
<EM>ImageOverlay</EM> widgets. Several man pages have been extended, e.g. the
one for the <EM>ximage</EM> toolkit, and numerous pages have been revised.
<P>

Improved the html descriptions. Hopefully not as many dead-end links.

<H3><a NAME="v3.3_new-visual">New X based visual programs</A></H3>

<H4>xfilter</H4>

An X based visual program for filter design. The input image, filter
and output image are displayed simultaneously along with their Fourier
transform magnitudes. The filter type and window function can be
selected from menus.

<H3><a NAME="v3.3_new-non-visual">New non-visual programs</A></H3>

All the non-visual programs are included in the menu hierarchy for
<EM>xshow</EM>, the main visual program in XITE.

<H4>bandpass</H4>

Replaces <EM>fftMakeBp</EM> (which is retained as a script calling
<EM>bandpass</EM>). <EM>bandpass</EM> has more options than
<EM>fftMakeBp</EM>. The filter can be returned in the spatial
or Fourier domain, the window function can be chosen among several
predefined types, and the pixel type can be chosen among all
non-integral types (i.e. real, double, complex and double complex)
when the filter is returned in the spatial domain.

Refer to the new <EM>window</EM> program below.

<H4>bandstop</H4>

Replaces <EM>fftMakeBs</EM> (which is retained as a script calling
<EM>bandstop</EM>). See <EM>bandpass</EM> above.

<H4>bdf2biff</H4>
Converts a BDF font file to a BIFF image.

<H4>biffwrite</H4>
Writes text on a BIFF image. Depends on BDF font files.

<H4>butterworth</H4>
Makes a Butterworth lowpass filter in the spatial or Fourier domain.

<H4>exponential</H4>
Makes an exponential lowpass filter in the spatial or Fourier domain.

<H4>fftMagPhase</H4>
2D Fourier transform and conversion into linear/logarithmic magnitude
and/or phase.

<H4>highpass</H4>
Replaces <EM>fftMakeHp</EM> (which is retained as a script calling
<EM>highpass</EM>). See <EM>bandpass</EM> above.

<H4>imag</H4>
Replaces <EM>fftImag</EM> (which is retained as a script calling
<EM>imag</EM>).

<H4>logarithm</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> Replaces <EM>fftDisplay</EM> (which is retained as a script calling
       <EM>logarithm</EM>).
  <LI> Changed <EM>logarithm()</EM> to use log10, not log (which gives ln).
  <LI> Output pixel type can be chosen among unsigned byte, real and double.
  <LI> Can handle all pixel types directly in the input image, without
       converting to complex.
  <LI> Improved efficiency for input pixeltypes UNS_BYTE, SIGN_BYTE,
       UNS_SHORT and SIGN_SHORT.
</UL>

<H4>lowpass</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> Replaces <EM>fftMakeLp</EM> (which is retained as a script calling
       <EM>lowpass</EM>). See <EM>bandpass</EM> above.
  <LI> Fixed bug when all filter-coefficients were zero (divide by zero in
       scaling).
  <LI> Major revision of lowpass-generating function which should now work
       irrespective of odd/even filter size and odd/even band size.
</UL>

<H4>lowpassIdeal</H4>
Makes an ideal lowpass filter in the spatial or Fourier domain.

<H4>phase</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> Replaces <EM>fftPhase</EM> (which is retained as a script calling
       <EM>phase</EM>).
  <LI> Added option <KBD>-shift</KBD>.
  <LI> Will give a real pixel type output for a complex pixel type input and
       a double pixel type output for a double complex pixel type input,
       unless option <KBD>-b</KBD> is used.
</UL>

<H4>power</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> Replaces <EM>fftPower</EM> (which is retained as a script calling
       <EM>power</EM>).
  <LI> Handles all input pixel types.
  <LI> Can scale the result.
  <LI> Output pixel type will be the same as the input pixel type, unless
       option <KBD>-real</KBD> is used. This will give a real output type for a
       complex input type and a double output type for a double complex input
       type.
</UL>

<H4>real</H4>
Replaces <EM>fftReal</EM> (which is retained as a script calling
<EM>real</EM>).

<H4>window</H4>
Makes a BIFF image containing a window function for filter design.

<H4>zernike</H4>
Computes Zernike moments for an image.

<H3><a NAME="v3.3_fix-visual">
New features and bug fixes for X based visual programs</A></H3>

<H4>General comments</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> All the programs are based on the <EM>ximage</EM> toolkit which is a
       part of XITE. See comments about changes to the toolkit further down.
  <LI> The images will by default be split from the control buttons. This
       enables ordinary resizing of all image widgets in all <EM>ximage</EM>
       based applications.
  <LI> The visual class of an image does not need to equal the default visual
       class of the display server.
  <LI> All the programs handle images displayed with different visual classes.
  <LI> Added menubar to <EM>Image</EM> and <EM>ImageOverlay</EM> widgets (no
       OverlayColors menu button for an <EM>Image</EM> widget).
  <LI> A new entry in the Tools menu can create a colorbar for the presently
       active colortable.
  <LI> The cursor position in every image can be traced.
  <LI> Honors setting of widget width without setting height, and vice
       versa, taking aspect ratio (fixed or variable) into consideration.
  <LI> The histogram entry in the Tools menu will now calculate the total
       histogram for a three-band rgb image if the right mousebutton is used
       to select the input image. Previously this would result in three
       histograms, one for each band. Using the middle mouse button will still
       create the histogram only of band numer one (i.e. the red band).
  <LI> Every image widget created via the "Send image" button in the histogram 
       window will have the correct callback functions installed and thus
       behave exactly as other image widgets.
  <LI> Replaced some Xaw widgets by Xfwf widgets. Also see the <EM>ximage</EM>
       option <KBD>-widgetset</KBD>.
  <LI> XPM (X Pixmap) pixmaps and functions are used. XITE supplies the
       necessary code and links with its own libxpm library, to avoid problems
       with non-existent or old versions of local XPM libraries.
  <LI> Renamed and added some options and application resources, including
       all the ones which <EM>xshow</EM> had.
  <LI> Fixed segmentation fault when the image display window only consisted
       of one screen pixel.
  <LI> The applications do not exit when a single image is closed.
</UL>

<H4>xshow</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> Also refer to the general comments about changes to visual programs
       above and changes to the <EM>ximage</EM> toolkit, <EM>Image</EM> and
       <EM>ImageOverlay</EM> widgets described below.
  <LI> Improved dialog appearance and input checking when <EM>xshow</EM>
       starts a program from the menu hierarchy.
  <LI> If a colortable or overlay table was produced by the same program
       which produced an image, this colortable will be used for the image.
       Otherwise, the default "Work-map" will be used.
  <LI> Fixed bug which sometimes made the main <EM>xshow</EM> menu disappear
       (e.g. when selecting FFT forward).
  <LI> Fixed bug where <EM>xshow</EM> sometimes would not pop up a submenu.
  <LI> Fixed old bug which sometimes made <EM>xshow</EM> crash when one widget
       among two or more from the same image was killed with the <KBD>q</KBD>
       key.
  <LI> The menu file format has been changed, but <EM>xshow</EM> can still
       read the old format.
  <LI> The XTERMOUT code (&lt;xterm&gt;) in a menu file entry is no longer
       removed, but replaced by (-1), the negative of the stdout
       filedescriptor. This means that the XTERMOUT code should be used when
       a program requires a filename for ascii output.
</UL>

<H4>xfft</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> Also refer to to the general comments about changes to visual programs
       above and changes to the <EM>ximage</EM> toolkit, <EM>Image</EM> and
       <EM>ImageOverlay</EM> widgets described below.
  <LI> Changed pixeltype of Fourier-transform band from unsigned byte to
       real. The old version could only handle unsigned byte output band,
       and the result would be truncated unless a scale-factor was supplied.
       This would give a saturated image. Now, the image should always appear
       correctly.
  <LI> The ROI (Region of interest) changes according to expand, shrink, zoom
       and pan.
</UL>

<H4>xhistogram</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> Also refer to to the general comments about changes to visual programs
       above and changes to the <EM>ximage</EM> toolkit, <EM>Image</EM> and
       <EM>ImageOverlay</EM> widgets described below.
  <LI> Added option <KBD>-split</KBD> to the main program. Default behavior
       is to calculate total histogram for all bands of an image.
       <KBD>-split</KBD> will calcaulate for each band separately.
</UL>

<H4>xmovie</H4>

<H3><a NAME="v3.3_fix-tools">
New features and bug fixes for toolkit, widgets and functions</A></H3>

<H4>ximage toolkit</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> Also see the general comments about
       <A HREF="#v3.3_fix-visual">changes to X-based visual programs</A>.
  <LI> The toolkit has been almost completely rewritten.
  <LI> Several new toolkit command-line options and application resources.
  <LI> <EM>Image</EM> and <EM>ImageOverlay</EM> widgets can now be displayed
       separately from buttons, sliders etc. The old behavior is still
       supported. The options <KBD>-layout</KBD>, <KBD>-panelcontainer</KBD>
       and <KBD>-adjustwidth</KBD> can be used to get the desired behavior.
  <LI> Displaying images separately from buttons etc. has the advantage that
       the images can be resized with the mouse, as usual for images controlled
       by the window manager.
  <LI> Image menus for Colors, OverlayColors, Tools, Options and Visuals
       are available to all applications based on the <EM>ximage</EM> toolkit.
       The OverlayColors menu is only available for <EM>ImageOverlay</EM>
       image widgets.
  <LI> Added widgettype "P" (Prompt), "l" (list) and "E" (small ascii).
  <LI> The user can choose between using Athena widgets Command and Toggle or
       the Free Widget Foundation widgets XfwfButton and XfwfToggle (with a
       runtime option).
  <LI> A new function <EM>ximageLayout</EM> can be used as an alternative to
       <EM>ximage_layout</EM>. The new function is more flexible.
  <LI> Widget types can now also be specified by descriptive words, not only
       one-letter codes.
  <LI> Added code to handle passing of callback-function-data to display
       functions (e.g. via histogram). This will make image widgets produced
       via the "Send image" button in the histogram window behave exactly
       like other image widgets.
  <LI> Added function close_shell (action function CloseShell) which replaces
       several other similar functions defined in some <EM>ximage</EM>-based
       applications.
  <LI> Changed resource instance name of image widgets to always be "image"
       when the widget is created via the <EM>ximage_layout</EM> or
       <EM>ximageLayout</EM> functions.
  <LI> Removed setting of fallback-resources.       
  <LI> Moved some of the color-resource checking to the <EM>Image</EM> and
       <EM>ImageOverlay</EM> widgets (in Initialize and SetValues methods).
</UL>

<H4>Image widget</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> Added a manual page comment for the widget.
  <LI> Added the readonly resource XtNimageRgb which keeps track of whether
       the widget displays one band or a three-band rgb image.
  <LI> Added checking of color resources (some code moved in from ximage.c,
       formerly Xdisplay.c). Checking is done both for Initialize() and
       SetValues() methods.
  <LI> Improved the SetValues() method to handle more situations of resource
       setting.
  <LI> Now only freeing pixmap memory if the pixmap size must change. This
       saves allocation time.
  <LI> Added WMColormap action-function. This will inform the window manager
       about which widgets need their colormap installed when the mouse pointer
       is inside the widgets. It was needed especially for the case of
       DirectColor visual and "reduced-color" display.
  <LI> Added tables tab128_s and tab256_s as default values for the XtNcolorPtr
       resource (set by the function deftab()).
  <LI> Added functions ImageCopyResources, ImageGetResources and
       ImageGetImageResources.
  <LI> Added functions ImageScreenToWidth(), ImageScreenToHeight(),
       ImageWidthToScreen() and ImageHeightToScreen().
  <LI> Made sure widget width or height does not become zero.
</UL>

<H4>ImageOverlay widget</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> Added checking of color resources in methods Initialize() and
       SetValues().
  <LI> Added resource <EM>roiZoomPan</EM> to enable resizing and panning of
       the ROI (Region of interest) along with widget zooming and panning.
  <LI> Changed the Redisplay() function (expose method) to take care of a ROI
       which should be zoomed and panned (via the resource roiZoomPan).
  <LI> Added functions ImageOverlayCopyResources, ImageOverlayGetResources
       and ImageOverlayGetImageOverlayResources.
  <LI> Made sure widget width or height does not become zero.
</UL>

<H4>InitMessage function</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> InitMessage now strips a trailing <KBD>.bin</KBD> from the program
       name, in order to work properly for the X based applications which
       are started via shell scripts.
</UL>

<H3><a NAME="v3.3_other">Other</A></H3>

<H4>Code improvements</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> Most of the code for the <EM>ximage</EM> toolkit and the main display
       program <EM>xshow</EM> has been rewritten.
  <LI> The header files related to image processing can now be used with C++.
</UL>

<H3><a NAME="v3.2_incompatibilities">Version incompatibilities</A></H3>

This version is incompatible with the previous version in the following areas
<UL>
  <LI> Changed parameter list for <EM>ximage_layout()</EM>. The first
       parameter must now always be non-NULL. It should be equal to the
       widget reference returned from <EM>ximage_init()</EM>. Setting this
       parameter equal to NULL in previous versions, resulted in a new window
       on the screen. This is now instead controlled by the new last parameter
       <EM>res_inst_name</EM> (short for <dfn>resource_instance_name</dfn>).
       This should supply the X instance name of the new widget (if you don't
       understand this, just supply an arbitrary string). If equal to NULL,
       there will not be a new window.
  <LI> Some widgets have changed class or instance name. If you have set
       X resources for these in an X resource file, the behaviour may not be
       what you expect. Check the documentation for the program you are running
       (if this is supplied with XITE). If you have written the program
       yourself, based on the ximage toolkit supplied with XITE, check the
       documentation for ximage.
  <LI> The widget hierarchies in the XITE display programs have changed.
       You may want to adjust any X resource settings you have made.

<H4>xshow</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> Bug fixes
  <UL>
    <LI> Fixed bug which caused crash if path in FileSelector window was
	 given as a single <KBD>~</KBD>.
    <LI> Fixed bug which sometimes caused crash during zooming.
    <LI> Removed warning if bits-per-rgb does not equal 8. bits-per-rgb
	 different from 8 has no influence on the way XITE display programs
	 behave. The bits-per-rgb characteristic is a measure of the
	 resolution of the D/A convertor in the display hardware.
    <LI> Fixed bug which caused crash if empty directory field was returned
	 in fileselector widget.
  </UL>
  <LI> Changes to main menu hierarchy
  <UL>
    <LI> Introduced a permanent separate window for the program menu
	 hierarchy, not launched by the "Run program" button in the Control
	 window.
    <LI> Submenus in the main menu-window require a mouse click to pop up.
	 Lower-level submenus may still pop up because of mouse movement.
    <LI> Made sure that submenus don't pop up too low or too far to the right
	 to be visible on the screen.
    <LI> Introduced possilibity for saving/sticking submenus on the screen.
    <LI> Installed keyboard accelerators/shortcuts in the Control window
	 for the quit, help and macro buttons as well as for popping up
	 submenus (temporary and permanent) and executing command entries.
    <LI> One may navigate in the permanent submenus with the keyboard
	 (arrow down/up or ctrl n/p) and command entries can be executed
	 with the Return key.
    <LI> Permanent submenus can be popped down with the <KBD>q</KBD> key.
    <LI> Added menu items for reading and copying only certain bands from
	 an image.
  </UL>
  <LI> Changes/additions to menu entries
  <UL>
    <LI> Made rainbow (in menu entry "Create ihs-based colormap") send output
	 to a separate xterm window which can be saved with Shift+Btn2.
    <LI> Made color2ascii (in menu entry "Colortable --> Ascii") send output
	 to a separate xterm window which can be saved with Shift+Btn2.
    <LI> Added menu entries for reading and copying only specific bands from
	 an image.
    <LI> The menu entry "Rgb --> pseudocolor" is now processed entirely
	 by colorquant, not by makepseudo.
  </UL>
  <LI> Other user-interface changes
  <UL>
    <LI> Removed "Run program" button from Control window.
    <LI> Changed position of Macro button in Control window.
    <LI> Removed macro filename from label in macro button.
    <LI> Added confirmation box for stopping macro logging.
    <LI> Made the Control window, histogram and slice applications better
	 at handling user-selected fonts, i.e. label/command
         widget widths are determined by chosen font/string.
    <LI> Control window now behaves better during a window manager resize.
    <LI> Changed width of term widget from 80 times max_bounds for font to
         80 times the width of the character <VAR>m</VAR>.
    <LI> Histogram data are now back in the top label of the histogram
	 window (accidentally removed).
    <LI> A fileselector widget is now used when saving the contents of an
	 xterm window to file.
    <LI> A fileselector widget is now used when sending a colortable from
	 the histogram application to a file.
  </UL>
  <LI> Changes to X resources
  <UL>
    <LI> The application resource file is no longer installed in the standard
	 app-defaults directory by the XITE installation procedure. Instead
	 <EM>xshow</EM> sets the environment variable XAPPLRESDIR (and
         possibly also
	 XUSERFILESEARCHPATH) appropriately, so that the resource file is
	 found in the directory $XITE_HOME/etc/app-defaults. This should not
	 make any difference to the typical user.
    <LI> The Control window is now also the main application shell generated
	 when the application is initialized.
    <LI> Changed the widgets of class Box to class Form in the Control window.
         This improves the behaviour when the window is resized.
    <LI> Changed instance names of Form widgets (which used to be Box widgets)
	 in the Control window.
    <LI> Added some constraint resources (like XtNfromHoriz and XtNright)
	 because of the above change of class from Box to Form.
    <LI> Instance name of macro button changed to action1Button.
    <LI> Main menu hierarchy starts with a widget of class TopLevelShell,
         popped up below the top application shell (Control window).
    <LI> Changed popup menus in the program menu hierarchy from class
	 MenuShell to class OverrideShell (to avoid the popup location to
	 depend on pointer position).
    <LI> Changed classes of menu command entry buttons and submenu buttons to
         MenuCommand and SubMenuCommand respectively (in order to be able to
         set common resources for all the widgets in each class).
    <LI> Changed image shell from separate ApplicationShell to a
	 TopLevelShell which is popped up from the Control window.
    <LI> Several Xslice resources removed because of hardcoding in source-code.
    <LI> Improved setting of width of stderr widget.
    <LI> Changed class of histogram application from ApplicationShell to
         TopLevelShell which is popped up from the corresponding image widget
         shell.
    <LI> Changed some hardcoded resource-settings for the histogram
	 application.
    <LI> Added setting of some constraint resources for the slice application.
    <LI> Changed xterm shell widget from ApplicationShell class to
	 TopLevelShell class which is popped up from the Control window.
    <LI> Set font of menu dialog-widget to fixed-width.
  </UL>
  <LI> Other changes
  <UL>
    <LI> If <EM>xshow</EM> is used at the end of a pipe, an argument of
	 <KBD>-</KBD> must be given to indicate that it should read from
	 stdin. Previously this argument was not needed.
  </UL>
</UL>

<H4>xadd, xfft, xhistogram, xmovie, xpyramid, xregion</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> The application resource file is no longer installed in the standard
       app-defaults directory by the XITE installation procedure. Instead
       each program sets the environment variable XAPPLRESDIR (and possibly
       also XUSERFILESEARCHPATH) appropriately, so that the resource file is
       found in the directory $XITE_HOME/etc/app-defaults. This should not
       make any difference to the typical user.

</UL>

<H4>xfft</H4>

<H4>Image and ImageOverlay widgets</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> Changes because image is now a popup child of Control widget.
  <LI> Made sure that widget is really resized fully when the window manager
       requests a resize.
  <LI> Changed SetValues() in terms of how the widget instance variable
       "update" is set and to give return-value depending on what instance
       variables were changed.
  <LI> Moved contents of SetValuesHook() into SetValues() (the hook procedure
       is obsolete since X11R4, though called by Xt for compatibility).
  <LI> Moved UPDATE_* constants from private header-file to public header-file.
  <LI> Fixed bug which sometimes caused crash during zooming.
</UL>

<H4>PrintColortable</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> Changed so that printed ascii colortable with hex-format pixelvalues
       has leading <SAMP>0x</SAMP>, not zeros. In this way, the program
       <EM>mct</EM> will determine the correct number base.
  <LI> Fixed bug so that it now should give the same output ascii format
       for pixelvalues in colortable regardless of host byteorder.

New version of User's Manual. Updates to several man-pages (and online
hypertext reference manual html-pages).

<H3><a NAME="v3.1a_fix-visual">
New features and bug fixes for X based visual programs</A></H3>

<H4>xshow</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> The file-browser widgets should now work also for Suns running
       Solaris 2.x (SunOS 5.x).
  <LI> The colortable in use for a particular image window will now be
       marked by an <SAMP>x</SAMP> next to the corresponding entry in the
       Colors menu. Likewise with the overlay colortable in use for a
       particular image window, it will be marked by an <SAMP>x</SAMP> next
       to the corresponding entry in the OverlayColors menu.
  <LI> The above changes mean that <EM>xshow</EM> now is able to keep track
       of which colortable and which overlay colortable is in use for each
       particular image window when more than one window are displayed at
       the same time. The behavior was rather confusing in the past.
  <LI> Not really a change, just a comment about behavior related to the
       handling of colortables and overlay colortables:

       All image windows still share the same list of colortables and
       overlay colortables. This means that two images with overlays
       can not use the same colortable and at the same time different
       overlay colortables. This is because the overlay colortables are
       installed as part of the ordinary colortables.

       Of course, one may add an extra copy of one of the colortables
       and use a different overlay colortable with this copy.
  <LI> Fixed the behavior of option <KBD>-overlay</KBD>. Now, each overlay given
       on the command-line will get the specified overlay colortable.
  <LI> Enabled reading of overlay colortables when a command-line argument
       has a leading <KBD>+</KBD> and the remaining argument refers to a
       colortable file. This was a documented possibility already, but it
       didn't work.

       An overlay will get the last overlay colortable specified in front of
       it on the command-line.
  <LI> The option <KBD>-p</KBD> for protection of the overlays has been fixed.
  <LI> Fixed the option <KBD>-i &lt;chan&gt;</KBD>. This makes it possible to
       fork <EM>xshow</EM>
       from inside another program and pipe images along a specified channel.
       This was a documented possiblity already, but it didn't work.
  <LI> An image overlay will now not disappear when colortable or overlay
       colortable is changed.
  <LI> Added a "Background" overlay colortable.
  <LI> Changed title of Overlay colortable menu, from Overlays to
       OverlayColors.
  <LI> Changed names of some standard colortables.
</UL>

<H4>xregion</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> Removed covar push-button. It didn't do anything anyway.
  <LI> Fixed bug which could sometimes result in the error message
       "broken pipe" and abortion on Silicon Graphics, when the statistics
       pushbutton is used.
  <LI> Mask image command-line argument is now checked to see that it is of
       type unsigned-byte.
  <LI> The option <KBD>-p</KBD> for protection of the overlays has been fixed.
  <LI> An image overlay will now not disappear when colortable or overlay
       colortable is changed.
</UL>

<H3><a NAME="v3.1a_fix-non-visual">

<H4>biffinfo</H4>
Changed behaviour so that a usage message is given if no image
is given on the command line (as filename or the special symbols
accepted by Iread_image()). This is standard XITE behaviour.

<H4>cdoc</H4>
Improvements to LaTeX, troff and html output.

<H4>statistics</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> Added option <KBD>-a</KBD> for user-decision of output format (number of
       significant digits) of integer and floating-point results.
  <LI> Added option <KBD>-h</KBD> for printing horizontal header above results.
  <LI> Fixed bugs which sometimes returned incorrect minimum and
       maximum values.
  <LI> Minor changes to semantics for some options.

  <LI> Added resource XtNoverlaytab to <EM>ImageOverlay</EM> Widget, to
       keep track of the overlay colortable in use.
</UL>

<H3><a NAME="v3.1a_other">Other code changes</A></H3>

<H4>include-directory</H4>
xite_random.h: Changed declarations under IBM AIX.


<H4>src-directory </H4>
<UL>
  <LI> ximage/xmovie.c: Renamed function usleep to avoid conflict under
       IBM AIX.
  <LI> xshow/Xdialog.c: Added arguments for window name and icon name to
       functions InformationBox, ConfirmationBox, SimpleDialog and
       CreateDialog
  <LI> xshow/Xcolor.c: Cleaned up in global variables and removed function
       Get_color() because keeping track of the colortable in use must be
       done by each image widget separately.
  <LI> xshow/Xcolor.c: Added functions ColorHook() and OverlayHook() to
       handle marking of color menu entries to show present colortable and
       overlay colortable in use for each image window.
  <LI> xshow/Xcolor.c: Fixed indexing of overlay colortables.
  <LI> xshow/Xcolor.c: Added function Color_ovl_max().

This version is incompatible with the previous version in the following areas
<UL>
  <LI> Function <EM>ximage_init()</EM> has an additional parameter
       <EM>warn</EM>. You should probably set this equal to zero.
       Setting it equal to 1 makes the function check that

<H3><a NAME="v3.1_documentation">Documentation</A></H3>

A <EM>reference manual</EM> is available in hypertext (html) format. This is
built automatically from the <code>man</code> pages when you install XITE.
The reference manual reflects the traditional <code>man</code> grouping into
sections as well as the <EM>xshow</EM> menu hierarchy.
<P>
The reference manual can be read independently with an html reader or be
shown from inside <EM>xshow</EM>. See the comments on <EM>xshow</EM> below.

<H4>xshow</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> Can also display images with signed byte pixels.
  <LI> Improved widget geometry negotiation when very narrow images are
       displayed.
  <LI> Fixed bug which made <EM>xshow</EM> crash when zooming in on images with
       very large pixelvalues (when the pixelvalues would be shown in
       ascii).
  <LI> There used to be a lower limit on how small subimages one could
       choose with the left mouse-button as input to a program. This limit
       has now been decreased so that images consisting of more than one
       pixel may now be chosen.
  <LI> The action of the help-button in the control window can now be chosen
       by the user. The action is to start one of a list of chosen help
       programs, such as <KBD>netscape, Mosaic, lynx, man</KBD>
       or <KBD>xman</KBD>.
       Choosing one of the three WWW browsers will bring up the front page
       of the XITE online hypertext reference manual. See <KBD>man xshow</KBD>
       for more information on this.
  <LI> <EM>xshow</EM> not only compiles and builds but now also runs under

<H3><a NAME="v3.0_incompatibilities">Version incompatibilities</A></H3>

This version is incompatible with the previous version in the following area

<H4>Byte-ordering for images</H4>

This version does automatic byte-swapping, as explained below in the section
Architectures/platforms. BIFF images written with a previous
version of XITE may give peculiar results when reading them with
version 3.0 or higher.
This will happen if an image with pixeltype other than unsigned byte or signed
byte was written with a little-endian host. Examples of little-endian
platforms are DecStation and Intel ix86, while most other platforms are
big-endian.<P>

The peculiar results may be an error message like "bus error" or
strange-looking images. Running the XITE program
<EM>statistics</EM>(1) on such an image
will typically give rather extreme values for Min and Max and the value NaN for
Mean and St.dev.<P>

The solution is to explicitly perform byte-swapping on the images. This is done
with the XITE program <EM>byteswap</EM>(1). Note that this is only
necessary for multi-byte pixeltypes.

<H3><a NAME="v3.0_main-features">Main new features</A></H3>

<H4>Menus</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> A simple macro-generator for <EM>xshow</EM>. It generates
       macros from mouse-button activity. This minimizes mouse usage when
       running a sequence of algorithms on different images.<P>

       The macro may optionally be appended as an entry in the menu
       hierarchy which will be updated on-the-fly.
  <LI> Multiple menufiles are handled by <EM>xshow</EM>, e.g. the
       menufile supplied
       with the XITE distribution, one site-specific file, one
       project-specific file and a personal file. They are all linked in
       the menu hierarchy in <EM>xshow</EM>.
  <LI> An expanded menu interface in <EM>xshow</EM>(1). Virtually
       all XITE programs are available from menu entries.
</UL>

<H4>Architectures/platforms</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> XITE also runs on 64-bit architectures (tested on Dec Alpha
       under OSF1).
  <LI> Architectures tested include: Silicon Graphics Indy under IRIX 5,
       Sun Sparc under SunOS 4, Dec Alpha under OSF1, Pentium PC under Linux,
       IBM RS 6000 under AIX and DecStation 5000 under ULTRIX 4.
  <LI> Automatic byte-swapping when reading BIFF images from a file with
       a foreign byte-ordering (little-endian versus big-endian).
</UL>

<H4>Format converters</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> Converters between XITE's file format BIFF and TIFF (Tag Image File
       Format) are included. See <EM>biff2tiff(1), biff2tiff(3),
       tiff2biff(1)</EM> and <EM>tiff2biff(3)</EM>.
  <LI> Converters between XITE's file format BIFF and MATLAB binary files
       are included. See <EM>matlab2biff(1), matlab2biff(3),
       biff2matlab(1), biff2matlab(3)</EM> and the MATLAB
       functions <EM>loadBiff</EM> and <EM>saveBiff</EM>.
  <LI> New program <EM>color2ascii</EM>(1).
</UL>

<H4>Algorithms</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> Lots of new thresholding/binarization algorithms, see
       <EM>binarize(1)</EM>.
  <LI> Routines and programs to extract rows, columns, cross-sections and
       lines with arbitrary inclination.  See <EM>profile(1), profile(3),
       crossSection(1), crossSection(3)</EM> and
       <EM>vectorPeak(3)</EM>.
</UL>

<H4>Colors and such</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> All the X11 programs now handle 24-bit color displays of visual types
       DirectColor and TrueColor, as well as 8-bit PseudoColor and
       GrayScale.
  <LI> All the supplied colortables work for both 8-bit and 24-bit pixels.
  <LI> New program <EM>color2ascii</EM>(1).
</UL>

<H4>Other changes to X user interface</H4>
<UL>
  <LI> New widgets (file browsers) for selecting input/output files in
       <EM>xshow</EM>(1).
  <LI> X11 resources can now be set by each individual user.
  <LI> Default X11 application resources files for the programs
       <EM>xshow, xregion, xmovie, xfft, xadd, xhistogram</EM>
       and <EM>xpyramid</EM>.
  <LI> All the X11 applications will behave gracefully when the window
       manager tries to kill a window.
  <LI> Fixed or variable aspect ratio in <EM>xshow</EM> is now
       local to each image, not a global setting. Can be controlled via
       menu and <EM>xshow</EM> option <KBD>-aspect</KBD>.
  <LI> Each image in <EM>xshow</EM> may have a menubar attached
       above it. Can be controlled via menu and <EM>xshow</EM>
       option <KBD>-mb</KBD>.
</UL>

<H3><a NAME="v3.0_fix-visual">

<H4>xshow</H4>

<UL>
<LI> Menus
<UL>
  <LI> A simple macro-generator which generates macros from
       mouse-button activity. This minimizes mouse usage when running a
       sequence of algorithms on different images.<P>

       The macro may optionally be appended as an entry in the menu
       hierarchy which will be updated on-the-fly.

       The macro-generator is limited to the programs accessed via the
       control window menu button and does not record activity in the
       image menubar or image popup menus.<P>
  <LI> Multiple menufiles are handled, e.g. the menufile supplied
       with the XITE distribution, one site-specific file, one
       project-specific file and a personal file. They are all linked in
       the menu hierarchy.
  <LI> An expanded menu interface. Virtually all XITE programs
       are available from menu entries.
  <LI> Each image may have a menubar attached above it. The menubar gives
       access to the same facilities as the popup menus inside the image.
       Can be controlled via menu and option <KBD>-mb</KBD>.
</UL>

<LI> Colors and such
<UL>
  <LI> Added the ability to load colortables into the slice tool, from file or
       from the corresponding image.
  <LI> Can handle displays with 24-bit DirectColor or TrueColor as their
       default visual type, as well as 8-bit PseudoColor and GrayScale.
  <LI> Made reduced-color the default at startup for 24-bit DirectColor.
  <LI> Changed the setting of colormap for text widgets to be the default
       colormap of the display. Should rather use Xmu functions which can
       give colormaps for available, non-default visuals.
  <LI> Checking inclusive or of color-masks when getting the list of
       available visuals. Must match what <EM>xshow</EM> expects (i.e. 0bbbbbb,
       where each <VAR>b</VAR> denotes 4 consecutive high bits).
  <LI> Added a warning if the bits_per_rgb of the display does not match
       what <EM>xshow</EM> expects.
  <LI> Denying change of overlay colors when default colormap is in use.
  <LI> Fixed a bug so that the line in the histogram widget with red
       mode is no longer blue, and vice versa.
  <LI> Generates better names for the colortables menu entries referring
       to the colortables used by the histogram and slice tools.
</UL>

<LI> Other changes to X user interface
<UL>
  <LI> Fixed or variable aspect ratio is now local to each image,
       not a global setting. Can be controlled individually via menu and
       initially via the option <KBD>-aspect</KBD>.
  <LI> Fixed options for width and height of image window.
  <LI> Added scrollbar to feedback widget.
  <LI> Added horizontal scrollbar to textual results widget.
  <LI> Changed flag menu entry label text form <SAMP>128 colors</SAMP> to
       <SAMP>Reduced colors</SAMP>.
  <LI> Changed Histogram widget button name from <SAMP>Hist.spec.</SAMP> to
       <SAMP>Piecewise linear</SAMP>.
  <LI> Made window name (as displayed by window manager) for the histogram
       and slice windows dependent on the particular image name.
  <LI> Added trailing <SAMP>...</SAMP> to submenu entries and the ability to
       have menu separators.
</UL>

<LI> Miscellaneous
<UL>
  <LI> Cleaned up in command-line options and usage message.
  <LI> Added warning for "Send image" (in Histogram widget) when image is
       not unsigned byte.
  <LI> Fixed bug to avoid some crashes when the number of widgets is high.
  <LI> Added option <KBD>-ver</KBD> to echo XITE version number.

<H4>scale</H4>
Special treatment for rounding of negative bytes, shorts and ints.

<H3><a NAME="v3.0_code">Code improvements</A></H3>
<UL>
  <LI> All the source code has been prototyped to enable type checking of
       parameters as described by the ANSI standard. Traditional compilers
       (K&amp;R code) can still be used, except for building the TIFF
       converters.
