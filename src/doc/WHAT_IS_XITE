Overview

   XITE consists of display programs with image widget and graphical user
   interface as well as more than 200 command line programs and 600
   subroutines, all documented on-line. XITE uses its own image file
   format (BIFF), but comes with converters between BIFF and TIFF, pnm,
   sunraster, raw, MATLAB and ascii.
   
   The command line programs and subroutine library are written in C and
   run under UNIX, Windows NT and Windows 95.
   
   The display programs run under UNIX. They work with images of
   arbitrary size and pixel type on 8-bit PseudoColor and 24-bit
   DirectColor and TrueColor X11 displays. Images can be zoomed and
   panned, and colortables can be selected from a menu. The main display
   program, xshow, gives access to most of the other command line
   programs via a menu interface which the user can customize and extend
   to include local programs. Input images for the menu entries can be
   selected with the mouse, and output images appear on the display.
   
   The available programs include operations such as statistics, merging,
   resampling, arithmetic/logical/relational operations, rotation,
   mirroring, affine transformations, convolution, filter design,
   Fourier/Hartley/Haar/Hough transforms, color manipulation, histogram
   transformations, global and local thresholding, binary thinning, edge
   detection, morphological operations, classification, image analysis
   and texture estimation.
   
   A toolkit is supplied to simplify development of X11 based
   applications.
   
Platforms

   XITE runs on (at least) the following platforms
     * Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 95 (not the X11 based display
       programs).
     * Solaris 2.x, x >= 5.
     * Silicon Graphics Indy under IRIX 5.3.
     * Silicon Graphics Power Challenge under IRIX 6.1.
     * Dec Alpha under OSF/1 V4.0.
     * IBM RS 6000 under AIX 4.1.
     * Linux on PC.
       
File format

   The file format is a raster format for 2D and 3D images. In case of
   3D, the image is viewed as a sequence of bands, the image may contain
   any number of bands. Each band may have its own size and pixel type.
   The image file contains the neccessary parameters (e.g. sizes and
   pixel types), pixel data ordered band by band, line by line; any
   amount of textual data, regularly used to store the processing history
   of the image; and finally any amount of other data. An internal C data
   structure is also defined, able to hold the whole image, information
   as well as pixels. The individual pixels are accessed by normal
   indexing. Simple routines are used to read (write) a whole image from
   (to) file or a channel, more complex routines are provided if you want
   to access only a part of the file.
   
Programs

     * X display programs, in particular xshow which has a graphical user
       interface to most of the other command based programs.
     * Format conversions for TIFF, pnm (pbm, pgm, ppm), raw binary,
       ascii, MATLAB, sunraster, PostScript.
     * Statistics: size, min, max, median, mean, standard deviation.
     * Image representation: subimages, merging images, pyramid, resample
     * Arithmetic operations: negate, scale, absolute value, complex
       conjugate, add, subtract, multiply, divide, square, square root,
       rms difference.
     * Logical operations.
     * Relational operations.
     * Rotation, mirroring, affine transformations.
     * Convolution, mean, Compass, Laplace, Gradient, Roberts, Sobel,
       Prewitt.
     * Filter design: Ideal lowpass, highpass, bandpass and bandstop
       filters.
     * Fourier transform, Hartley transform, Haar transform, Hough
       transform, geometric transformations, Zernike moments.
     * Color manipulation: Gamma correction, dithering, quantization,
       ihs-to-rgb, rgb-to-ihs, rgb-to-pseudocolor, pseudocolor-to-rgb
     * Histogram, scattergram, histogram transformations (equalization,
       normalization).
     * Global and local tresholding.
     * Binary thinning.
     * Canny edge detection.
     * Local operators median, min, max, sigma, knn, kncn, snn and others
       based on local standard deviation.
     * Genererate, add or multiply gaussian noise; generate or add
       Poisson noise.
     * Morphological operations.
     * Non-supervised classification.
     * Image analysis: measuring area, perimeter, moments etc.
     * Texture estimation: lit, lit-snn, glcm, gray-level run etc.
       
Routines

   All routines are written in C, and you will find
     * Everything listed above.
     * Biff-routines for image treatment (mainly I/O).
     * Image widget, histogram widget and ximage toolkit for writing X11
       based applications.
       
Documentation

   Manual pages are supplied for all functions and programs, in "man"
   format as well as html. A User's Manual and System Administrator's
   Manual are included as PostScript documents and available in html
   format from the XITE WWW homepage.
   
Time consumption

   The algorithms below are tested on images of size 512x512x1 byte. Time
   consumption (user time) is measured by the program "time" under UNIX,
   and displayed in seconds.
