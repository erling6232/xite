Changes between version 3.41 and 3.42

     * Fixed makefiles for OSF1 to enable building of dynamic libraries.
     * Fixed bug which prevented specifying only one of the parameters
       for image width or height when running display programs which use
       the ImageOverlay widget.
     * _biff2pnm_: Fixed segmentation violation bug. Removed option -rgb.
       BIFF images with three bands are automatically converted to ppm
       format. The conversions are now performed by functions which can
       be linked with other programs. See the function manual page for
       _biff2pnm_.
     * _pnm2biff_: The conversions are now performed by functions which
       can be linked with other programs. See the function manual page
       for _pnm2biff_.
     * _glcmParameter_: Various bug fixes in calculating the GLCM
       parameters.
     * _stdev_: Fixed bug which showed up with some linkers.
       
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
Changes in patch 3.41

     * New programs: _xwarp_ and accompanying script _warpExAnalysis_.
     * New functions: _warp_, _ioWarpMapping_ and _warp_resample_.
     * _xmovie_: Handles any pixel type
       
   .
   
     _xshow_: Added option -dialog_defaults to automatically accept
   dialog defaults, without popping up any dialog window.
   
     Changed name of type ImageData to ImageDataReg in region.h to avoid
   naming conflict.
   
     The System Administrator's Manual and the User's Manual are also
   supplied in PDF format, to be read e.g. with acroread.

     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  Main new features
  
     * The non-visual programs run under Windows NT version 4 and Windows
       95. The routine library of non-visual functions is also available.
       Differences between the NT/95 version and the Unix versions:
          + The notation for specifying a subset of bands when reading
            from a BIFF file uses ";" as band specification separator
            under Windows NT/95 (and ":" under UNIX).
          + _cdoc_ can not make symbolic links under NT/95 while
            producing reference documentation. Files are copied instead.
          + _colorquant_ has no timing support under NT/95.
          + For tilde ("~") expansion of path-names, the environment
            variable HOMEPATH is checked under Windows NT/95 if the
            environment variable HOME is not set. The password database
            is not used.
       Also note that the -man and -whatis options work under Windows
       NT/95.
       
  Version incompatibilities
  
   This version is compatible with the previous version, except for the
   arguments of the function _scatter_.
   
  Installation
  
     * Dynamic shared libraries (dynamic-link libraries on Windows NT/95)
       are created by default for some platforms. This, in addition to
       other compilation changes, greatly reduces required disk space for
       the executable binaries. Typically only one sixth of the space is
       needed.
     * MATLAB- and TIFF-dependent functions are put in separate
       libraries.
     * Removed all dependencies on _csh_.
     * Adapted for Windows NT/95, when installation is run under UNIX.
       Compilation and linking must of course be run under NT, but
       makefiles etc can be created under UNIX.
     * Separate installation for precompiled NT/95 distribution.
       
  Documentation
  
   Updated manuals for NT/95. Various other updates and extensions to the
   reference manual.
   
  New non-visual programs
  
    mkMorph
    
   _mkMorph_ can be used to create a structuring element for
   morphological operations. It is included in the menu hierarchy for
   _xshow_.
   
  New features and bug fixes for X based visual programs
  
    All programs
    
     * Fixed bug which made histograms and cumulative histograms of very
       large images get a very coarse appearance (a quantization of the
       correct curves). The maximum histogram value now touches the top
       of the display area.
     * The Image Information entry in the Tools menu of the _Image_
       Widget works also for images with pixel type complex and double
       complex.
     * Zooming in on a complex-valued image will show the numerical pixel
       values.
     * Fixed floating exception error on Dec alpha and Linux.
     * Avoiding some unnecessary resizing and exposure calls.
     * The histogram and slice tools in the _Image_ widget don't crash on
       complex-valued images.
       
    xfilter
    
     * Added difference widget.
     * New option: -wdiff.
     * Obsolete option: -wall.
     * Added application resources.
     * All options have their application resource counterpart.
       
    xhistogram
    
   Removed the possibility of giving an <outimage> command-line argument.
   The functionality is provided by _xshow_ and various command-line
   based histogram programs.
   
    xshow
    
     * Reading/copying a subset of bands from a memory-intensive image is
       much more efficient, using only the memory necessary for the
       requested bands.
     * The control widget will display pixel values also for
       complex-valued images.
     * Added _mkMorph_ to menu hierarchy.
     * Removed _image_minmax_ from menu hierarchy. _statistics_ covers
       this functionality.
     * Fixed the macro function for the case when no menu-file could be
       edited (no private file and no writable public file). Expanding
       tilde in menu-file names.
       
  New features and bug fixes for non-visual programs
  
    All programs
    
   Using the environment variable MESSAGEPROG now works. Did it ever
   work? The environment variable can now also take options and
   arguments.
   
    biff2matlab, matlab2biff, loadBiff, saveBiff
    
   Converted to MATLAB 5.1.
   
    biff2sunraster
    
     * Accepts three-band rgb images, converting to 24-bit Sun
       rasterfiles.
     * Accepts standard XITE filenames ("-", "-0", "-1").
       
    biffcopy
    
   Extracting a subset of bands from a memory-intensive image is much
   more efficient, using only the memory necessary for the requested
   bands.
   
    biffinfo
    
     * Will handle more than one stdin input argument.
     * Will handle band specification also when appended to stdin input
       argument.
     * Band specification on file name can be mixed with option -n.
     * Options can not any longer be grouped, they must be space
       separated.
       
    glRunLength
    
     * Fixed bug which required exactly two command-line arguments in
       addition to options.
     * Improved output appearance.
       
    glcm
    
     * Initialized output band (GLCM matrix) properly to zeros, to avoid
       uninitialized output pixels for input pixel values greater than
       num_greylevels.
     * Avoid processing remaining bands only if there is a real error
       condition in _glcm()_, not for a warning condition.
       
    glcmParameter
    
     * Avoids scaling error when the GLCM matrix contains only zeros.
     * Initializing the GLCM matrix if the -mkglcm option is used.
       
    houghCircle
    
   Function _drawCircle()_ made public.
   
    houghLine
    
     * Function _drawLine()_ made public.
     * Giving special treatment to the case of theta=90 degrees.
       
    imag
    
   Removed "Bus error" when input pixeltype is dcomplex and output
   pixel-type is double.
   
    morphDilate
    
   Fixed bug in calculating maximum values.
   
    scatter
    
   Function _scatter()_ requires an additional argument.
   
    statistics
    
     * Can also handle complex-valued images (added function
       _cstatistic()_).
     * Fixed the calculation of mean value for unsigned byte images to
       avoid integer overflow (and thus negative mean).
     * Fixed the calculation of minimum and maximum value when only these
       two parameters were requested in the call to the _statistic()_
       function.
     * Options can not any longer be grouped, they must be space
       separated.
       
    sunraster2biff
    
     * Handles images with odd width correctly.
     * Handles 24-bit BGR and RGB as well as 32-bit XBGR and XRGB
       rasterfiles, all converted to three-band rgb BIFF images.
     * Handles depth-1 rasterfiles correctly.
     * Accepts old-format Sun rasterfiles.
     * Accepts standard XITE filenames ("-", "-0", "-1").
       
  New features and bug fixes for toolkit, widgets and functions
  
    BIFF library
    
     * Added functions _Iread_image_bands_, _Idel_band_pix_,
       _Iparse_band_spec_, _Ifilename_part_, _Iparse_filename_,
       _IpixPrintFormat_.
     * Improved the handling of input pipes.
     * Using ";" as band specification separator under Windows NT/95.
     * _Iopen_image_ can now handle file names with band specification
       appended.
       
    ximage toolkit
    
     * The _ximageInit_ function now processes both the standard _ximage_
       application resources and those described by the resources
       argument (instead of processing only the latter when they are
       supplied). The options table argument should be the concatenation
       of options tables for standard ximage options and any new options
       corresponding to the additional application resources.
     * Added functions _ximage_app_resources()_ and
       _ximage_app_options()_.
     * Applications written without accompanying X resource files get
       reasonable appearances.
     * Label widgets can now be from the Xaw or Xfwf widget set.
       
    cxite compilation/linking tool
    
     * Added option -R.
     * Added platform-dependent compile- and link-flags. This takes care
       of using whatever definitions and libraries XITE is built with
       when you build your own XITE-dependent application. An example is
       to use Unix BSD definitions and libraries under SunOS5.

     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  Version incompatibilities
  
   This version is compatible with the previous version.
   
  Documentation
  
   A number of new man pages are available, e.g. for the _Image_ and
   _ImageOverlay_ widgets. Several man pages have been extended, e.g. the
   one for the _ximage_ toolkit, and numerous pages have been revised.
   
   Improved the html descriptions. Hopefully not as many dead-end links.
   
  New X based visual programs
  
    xfilter
    
   An X based visual program for filter design. The input image, filter
   and output image are displayed simultaneously along with their Fourier
   transform magnitudes. The filter type and window function can be
   selected from menus.
   
  New non-visual programs
  
   All the non-visual programs are included in the menu hierarchy for
   _xshow_, the main visual program in XITE.
   
    bandpass
    
   Replaces _fftMakeBp_ (which is retained as a script calling
   _bandpass_). _bandpass_ has more options than _fftMakeBp_. The filter
   can be returned in the spatial or Fourier domain, the window function
   can be chosen among several predefined types, and the pixel type can
   be chosen among all non-integral types (i.e. real, double, complex and
   double complex) when the filter is returned in the spatial domain.
   Refer to the new _window_ program below.
   
    bandstop
    
   Replaces _fftMakeBs_ (which is retained as a script calling
   _bandstop_). See _bandpass_ above.
   
    bdf2biff
    
   Converts a BDF font file to a BIFF image.
   
    biffwrite
    
   Writes text on a BIFF image. Depends on BDF font files.
   
    butterworth
    
   Makes a Butterworth lowpass filter in the spatial or Fourier domain.
   
    exponential
    
   Makes an exponential lowpass filter in the spatial or Fourier domain.
   
    fftMagPhase
    
   2D Fourier transform and conversion into linear/logarithmic magnitude
   and/or phase.
   
    highpass
    
   Replaces _fftMakeHp_ (which is retained as a script calling
   _highpass_). See _bandpass_ above.
   
    imag
    
   Replaces _fftImag_ (which is retained as a script calling _imag_).
   
    logarithm
    
     * Replaces _fftDisplay_ (which is retained as a script calling
       _logarithm_).
     * Changed _logarithm()_ to use log10, not log (which gives ln).
     * Output pixel type can be chosen among unsigned byte, real and
       double.
     * Can handle all pixel types directly in the input image, without
       converting to complex.
     * Improved efficiency for input pixeltypes UNS_BYTE, SIGN_BYTE,
       UNS_SHORT and SIGN_SHORT.
       
    lowpass
    
     * Replaces _fftMakeLp_ (which is retained as a script calling
       _lowpass_). See _bandpass_ above.
     * Fixed bug when all filter-coefficients were zero (divide by zero
       in scaling).
     * Major revision of lowpass-generating function which should now
       work irrespective of odd/even filter size and odd/even band size.
       
    lowpassIdeal
    
   Makes an ideal lowpass filter in the spatial or Fourier domain.
   
    phase
    
     * Replaces _fftPhase_ (which is retained as a script calling
       _phase_).
     * Added option -shift.
     * Will give a real pixel type output for a complex pixel type input
       and a double pixel type output for a double complex pixel type
       input, unless option -b is used.
       
    power
    
     * Replaces _fftPower_ (which is retained as a script calling
       _power_).
     * Handles all input pixel types.
     * Can scale the result.
     * Output pixel type will be the same as the input pixel type, unless
       option -real is used. This will give a real output type for a
       complex input type and a double output type for a double complex
       input type.
       
    real
    
   Replaces _fftReal_ (which is retained as a script calling _real_).
   
    window
    
   Makes a BIFF image containing a window function for filter design.
   
    zernike
    
   Computes Zernike moments for an image.
   
  New features and bug fixes for X based visual programs
  
    General comments
    
     * All the programs are based on the _ximage_ toolkit which is a part
       of XITE. See comments about changes to the toolkit further down.
     * The images will by default be split from the control buttons. This
       enables ordinary resizing of all image widgets in all _ximage_
       based applications.
     * The visual class of an image does not need to equal the default
       visual class of the display server.
     * All the programs handle images displayed with different visual
       classes.
     * Added menubar to _Image_ and _ImageOverlay_ widgets (no
       OverlayColors menu button for an _Image_ widget).
     * A new entry in the Tools menu can create a colorbar for the
       presently active colortable.
     * The cursor position in every image can be traced.
     * Honors setting of widget width without setting height, and vice
       versa, taking aspect ratio (fixed or variable) into consideration.
     * The histogram entry in the Tools menu will now calculate the total
       histogram for a three-band rgb image if the right mousebutton is
       used to select the input image. Previously this would result in
       three histograms, one for each band. Using the middle mouse button
       will still create the histogram only of band numer one (i.e. the
       red band).
     * Every image widget created via the "Send image" button in the
       histogram window will have the correct callback functions
       installed and thus behave exactly as other image widgets.
     * Replaced some Xaw widgets by Xfwf widgets. Also see the _ximage_
       option -widgetset.
     * XPM (X Pixmap) pixmaps and functions are used. XITE supplies the
       necessary code and links with its own libxpm library, to avoid
       problems with non-existent or old versions of local XPM libraries.
     * Renamed and added some options and application resources,
       including all the ones which _xshow_ had.
     * Fixed segmentation fault when the image display window only
       consisted of one screen pixel.
     * The applications do not exit when a single image is closed.
       
    xshow
    
     * Also refer to the general comments about changes to visual
       programs above and changes to the _ximage_ toolkit, _Image_ and
       _ImageOverlay_ widgets described below.
     * Improved dialog appearance and input checking when _xshow_ starts
       a program from the menu hierarchy.
     * If a colortable or overlay table was produced by the same program
       which produced an image, this colortable will be used for the
       image. Otherwise, the default "Work-map" will be used.
     * Fixed bug which sometimes made the main _xshow_ menu disappear
       (e.g. when selecting FFT forward).
     * Fixed bug where _xshow_ sometimes would not pop up a submenu.
     * Fixed old bug which sometimes made _xshow_ crash when one widget
       among two or more from the same image was killed with the q key.
     * The menu file format has been changed, but _xshow_ can still read
       the old format.
     * The XTERMOUT code (<xterm>) in a menu file entry is no longer
       removed, but replaced by (-1), the negative of the stdout
       filedescriptor. This means that the XTERMOUT code should be used
       when a program requires a filename for ascii output.
       
    xfft
    
     * Also refer to to the general comments about changes to visual
       programs above and changes to the _ximage_ toolkit, _Image_ and
       _ImageOverlay_ widgets described below.
     * Changed pixeltype of Fourier-transform band from unsigned byte to
       real. The old version could only handle unsigned byte output band,
       and the result would be truncated unless a scale-factor was
       supplied. This would give a saturated image. Now, the image should
       always appear correctly.
     * The ROI (Region of interest) changes according to expand, shrink,
       zoom and pan.
       
    xhistogram
    
     * Also refer to to the general comments about changes to visual
       programs above and changes to the _ximage_ toolkit, _Image_ and
       _ImageOverlay_ widgets described below.
     * Added option -split to the main program. Default behavior is to
       calculate total histogram for all bands of an image. -split will
       calcaulate for each band separately.
       
    xmovie
    
     * Also refer to the general comments about changes to visual
       programs above and changes to the _ximage_ toolkit, _Image_ and
       _ImageOverlay_ widgets described below.
     * Removed limitation of maximum 256 bands.
     * Added option -f.
       
    xpyramid
    
     * Changed to use the _ximage_ toolkit.
     * Also refer to to the general comments about changes to visual
       programs above and changes to the _ximage_ toolkit, _Image_ and
       _ImageOverlay_ widgets described below.
     * Fixed bug so that it will now really use the number of colors
       chosen.
       
  New features and bug fixes for non-visual programs
  
    General comments
    
     * Each pixel type has a string representation which can be used on
       the command line of programs which need pixel type input.
     * All (hopefully) programs and public functions check that the pixel
       type of image bands are correct.
       
    absValue
    
     * Added option -real.
     * Changed absolute value of complex from separate absolute value of
       real and imaginary parts to length of complex vector.
     * Allowing complex input band to result in real output band and
       double complex input band to result in double output band.
       
    ascii2biff
    
   Can now also read ascii images which have coordinate system added by
   _biff2ascii_.
   
    average
    
     * The bands in the averaging can now have different pixeltypes. This
       could previously give erroneous results, because only the type of
       the first band was tested.
     * Can now process bands from several input images.
     * Changed scale parameter from integer to double.
       
    biff2pnm
    
   Now works correctly with all BIFF pixeltypes (converting to unsigned
   byte or unsigned short, though without scaling).
   
    biff2ps
    
   Requiring arguments for input- and output-files (could be "-" variants
   as usual).
   
    biff2sunraster
    
   Can now handle all pixeltypes (but without scaling).
   
    biff2tiff
    
   Fixed crash.
   
    biffcopy
    
   Accepts multiple -band options.
   
    binarize
    
   Removed "bus error" for method Ab.
   
    canny
    
   Fixed bug in generation of canny filters.
   
    color2ascii
    
   Changed interpretation of filename argument. Empty filename is no
   longer interpreted. Both - and -1 mean stdout. Removed option -o.
   
    colorquant
    
   Fixed bug in pixelvalue calculation for BIFF colortable file.
   
    crossSection
    
   Fixed functions to really be able to handle any pixeltype.
   
    fht2d
    
   Changed the fht2d function so as not to change the input band. Also
   fixed memory read error.
   
    glcmParameter
    
   Avoiding "bus error".
   
    houghCircle
    
   Initializing band correctly.
   
    houghLine
    
   Fixed rounding error.
   
    linearTrans
    
   Fixed addressing which caused "segmentation fault" on some
   architectures.
   
    matlab2biff
    
   Removed mxFree-statement which caused errors in conversion.
   
    maxarea
    
   Made sure that index does not go outside image bounds.
   
    pnm2biff
    
   Fixed addressing bug in BIFF image band.
   
    pseudo2rgb
    
   Fixed "bus error" bug caused by the color handling using the complete
   24-bit pixel-value in a colortable, not only the pseudocolor part.
   
    pyramid
    
   Testing that the number of levels is not too high. This would generate
   bands of size 0 which _xshow_ does not like.
   
    rainbow
    
   Requiring <outfile> argument to be given.
   
    rms
    
   Added all pixeltypes.
   
    segmSpannWilson
    
   Avoiding "segmentation fault" error.
   
    statistics
    
     * Fixed bug in calculating standard deviation (at least buggy on
       SGI). Now works fine also on e.g. unsigned short pixeltype.
     * Can now read from multiple - file arguments.
       
  New features and bug fixes for toolkit, widgets and functions
  
    ximage toolkit
    
     * Also see the general comments about changes to X-based visual
       programs.
     * The toolkit has been almost completely rewritten.
     * Several new toolkit command-line options and application
       resources.
     * _Image_ and _ImageOverlay_ widgets can now be displayed separately
       from buttons, sliders etc. The old behavior is still supported.
       The options -layout, -panelcontainer and -adjustwidth can be used
       to get the desired behavior.
     * Displaying images separately from buttons etc. has the advantage
       that the images can be resized with the mouse, as usual for images
       controlled by the window manager.
     * Image menus for Colors, OverlayColors, Tools, Options and Visuals
       are available to all applications based on the _ximage_ toolkit.
       The OverlayColors menu is only available for _ImageOverlay_ image
       widgets.
     * Added widgettype "P" (Prompt), "l" (list) and "E" (small ascii).
     * The user can choose between using Athena widgets Command and
       Toggle or the Free Widget Foundation widgets XfwfButton and
       XfwfToggle (with a runtime option).
     * A new function _ximageLayout_ can be used as an alternative to
       _ximage_layout_. The new function is more flexible.
     * Widget types can now also be specified by descriptive words, not
       only one-letter codes.
     * Added code to handle passing of callback-function-data to display
       functions (e.g. via histogram). This will make image widgets
       produced via the "Send image" button in the histogram window
       behave exactly like other image widgets.
     * Added function close_shell (action function CloseShell) which
       replaces several other similar functions defined in some
       _ximage_-based applications.
     * Changed resource instance name of image widgets to always be
       "image" when the widget is created via the _ximage_layout_ or
       _ximageLayout_ functions.
     * Removed setting of fallback-resources.
     * Moved some of the color-resource checking to the _Image_ and
       _ImageOverlay_ widgets (in Initialize and SetValues methods).
       
    Image widget
    
     * Added a manual page comment for the widget.
     * Added the readonly resource XtNimageRgb which keeps track of
       whether the widget displays one band or a three-band rgb image.
     * Added checking of color resources (some code moved in from
       ximage.c, formerly Xdisplay.c). Checking is done both for
       Initialize() and SetValues() methods.
     * Improved the SetValues() method to handle more situations of
       resource setting.
     * Now only freeing pixmap memory if the pixmap size must change.
       This saves allocation time.
     * Added WMColormap action-function. This will inform the window
       manager about which widgets need their colormap installed when the
       mouse pointer is inside the widgets. It was needed especially for
       the case of DirectColor visual and "reduced-color" display.
     * Added tables tab128_s and tab256_s as default values for the
       XtNcolorPtr resource (set by the function deftab()).
     * Added functions ImageCopyResources, ImageGetResources and
       ImageGetImageResources.
     * Added functions ImageScreenToWidth(), ImageScreenToHeight(),
       ImageWidthToScreen() and ImageHeightToScreen().
     * Made sure widget width or height does not become zero.
       
    ImageOverlay widget
    
     * Added checking of color resources in methods Initialize() and
       SetValues().
     * Added resource _roiZoomPan_ to enable resizing and panning of the
       ROI (Region of interest) along with widget zooming and panning.
     * Changed the Redisplay() function (expose method) to take care of a
       ROI which should be zoomed and panned (via the resource
       roiZoomPan).
     * Added functions ImageOverlayCopyResources,
       ImageOverlayGetResources and ImageOverlayGetImageOverlayResources.
     * Made sure widget width or height does not become zero.
       
    InitMessage function
    
     * InitMessage now strips a trailing .bin from the program name, in
       order to work properly for the X based applications which are
       started via shell scripts.
       
  Other
  
    Code improvements
    
     * Most of the code for the _ximage_ toolkit and the main display
       program _xshow_ has been rewritten.
     * The header files related to image processing can now be used with
       C++.
       
    cxite
    
   The compilation/linking script also links with libxiteX.a and
   libxpm.a.
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
Changes between versions 3.1b and 3.2

     * Version incompatibilites
     * New features and bug fixes for X based visual programs
     * New features and bug fixes for non-visual programs
     * New features and bug fixes for toolkit, widgets and functions
       
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  Version incompatibilities
  
   This version is incompatible with the previous version in the
   following areas
     * Changed parameter list for _ximage_layout()_. The first parameter
       must now always be non-NULL. It should be equal to the widget
       reference returned from _ximage_init()_. Setting this parameter
       equal to NULL in previous versions, resulted in a new window on
       the screen. This is now instead controlled by the new last
       parameter _res_inst_name_ (short for resource_instance_name). This
       should supply the X instance name of the new widget (if you don't
       understand this, just supply an arbitrary string). If equal to
       NULL, there will not be a new window.
     * Some widgets have changed class or instance name. If you have set
       X resources for these in an X resource file, the behaviour may not
       be what you expect. Check the documentation for the program you
       are running (if this is supplied with XITE). If you have written
       the program yourself, based on the ximage toolkit supplied with
       XITE, check the documentation for ximage.
     * The widget hierarchies in the XITE display programs have changed.
       You may want to adjust any X resource settings you have made.
       
  New features and bug fixes for X based visual programs
  
    xshow
    
     * Bug fixes
          + Fixed bug which caused crash if path in FileSelector window
            was given as a single ~.
          + Fixed bug which sometimes caused crash during zooming.
          + Removed warning if bits-per-rgb does not equal 8.
            bits-per-rgb different from 8 has no influence on the way
            XITE display programs behave. The bits-per-rgb characteristic
            is a measure of the resolution of the D/A convertor in the
            display hardware.
          + Fixed bug which caused crash if empty directory field was
            returned in fileselector widget.
     * Changes to main menu hierarchy
          + Introduced a permanent separate window for the program menu
            hierarchy, not launched by the "Run program" button in the
            Control window.
          + Submenus in the main menu-window require a mouse click to pop
            up. Lower-level submenus may still pop up because of mouse
            movement.
          + Made sure that submenus don't pop up too low or too far to
            the right to be visible on the screen.
          + Introduced possilibity for saving/sticking submenus on the
            screen.
          + Installed keyboard accelerators/shortcuts in the Control
            window for the quit, help and macro buttons as well as for
            popping up submenus (temporary and permanent) and executing
            command entries.
          + One may navigate in the permanent submenus with the keyboard
            (arrow down/up or ctrl n/p) and command entries can be
            executed with the Return key.
          + Permanent submenus can be popped down with the q key.
          + Added menu items for reading and copying only certain bands
            from an image.
     * Changes/additions to menu entries
          + Made rainbow (in menu entry "Create ihs-based colormap") send
            output to a separate xterm window which can be saved with
            Shift+Btn2.
          + Made color2ascii (in menu entry "Colortable --> Ascii") send
            output to a separate xterm window which can be saved with
            Shift+Btn2.
          + Added menu entries for reading and copying only specific
            bands from an image.
          + The menu entry "Rgb --> pseudocolor" is now processed
            entirely by colorquant, not by makepseudo.
     * Other user-interface changes
          + Removed "Run program" button from Control window.
          + Changed position of Macro button in Control window.
          + Removed macro filename from label in macro button.
          + Added confirmation box for stopping macro logging.
          + Made the Control window, histogram and slice applications
            better at handling user-selected fonts, i.e. label/command
            widget widths are determined by chosen font/string.
          + Control window now behaves better during a window manager
            resize.
          + Changed width of term widget from 80 times max_bounds for
            font to 80 times the width of the character m.
          + Histogram data are now back in the top label of the histogram
            window (accidentally removed).
          + A fileselector widget is now used when saving the contents of
            an xterm window to file.
          + A fileselector widget is now used when sending a colortable
            from the histogram application to a file.
     * Changes to X resources
          + The application resource file is no longer installed in the
            standard app-defaults directory by the XITE installation
            procedure. Instead _xshow_ sets the environment variable
            XAPPLRESDIR (and possibly also XUSERFILESEARCHPATH)
            appropriately, so that the resource file is found in the
            directory $XITE_HOME/etc/app-defaults. This should not make
            any difference to the typical user.
          + The Control window is now also the main application shell
            generated when the application is initialized.
          + Changed the widgets of class Box to class Form in the Control
            window. This improves the behaviour when the window is
            resized.
          + Changed instance names of Form widgets (which used to be Box
            widgets) in the Control window.
          + Added some constraint resources (like XtNfromHoriz and
            XtNright) because of the above change of class from Box to
            Form.
          + Instance name of macro button changed to action1Button.
          + Main menu hierarchy starts with a widget of class
            TopLevelShell, popped up below the top application shell
            (Control window).
          + Changed popup menus in the program menu hierarchy from class
            MenuShell to class OverrideShell (to avoid the popup location
            to depend on pointer position).
          + Changed classes of menu command entry buttons and submenu
            buttons to MenuCommand and SubMenuCommand respectively (in
            order to be able to set common resources for all the widgets
            in each class).
          + Changed image shell from separate ApplicationShell to a
            TopLevelShell which is popped up from the Control window.
          + Several Xslice resources removed because of hardcoding in
            source-code.
          + Improved setting of width of stderr widget.
          + Changed class of histogram application from ApplicationShell
            to TopLevelShell which is popped up from the corresponding
            image widget shell.
          + Changed some hardcoded resource-settings for the histogram
            application.
          + Added setting of some constraint resources for the slice
            application.
          + Changed xterm shell widget from ApplicationShell class to
            TopLevelShell class which is popped up from the Control
            window.
          + Set font of menu dialog-widget to fixed-width.
     * Other changes
          + If _xshow_ is used at the end of a pipe, an argument of -
            must be given to indicate that it should read from stdin.
            Previously this argument was not needed.
       
    xadd, xfft, xhistogram, xmovie, xpyramid, xregion
    
     * The application resource file is no longer installed in the
       standard app-defaults directory by the XITE installation
       procedure. Instead each program sets the environment variable
       XAPPLRESDIR (and possibly also XUSERFILESEARCHPATH) appropriately,
       so that the resource file is found in the directory
       $XITE_HOME/etc/app-defaults. This should not make any difference
       to the typical user.
       
    xadd
    
   Using file-selector widget to get filenames.
   
    xfft, xmovie, xshow
    
     * Additional toplevel widgets are now pop-up widgets of class
       TopLevelShell, not ApplicationShell. This means that some X
       resource specifications have changed.
     * Fixed bug which sometimes caused crash during zooming.
       
    xfft
    
     * Fixed info() to report current values, not constants.
     * Improved treatment of roixsize and roiysize (independent).
     * Using file-selector widget to get filenames.
       
    ximage_example
    
     * Updated since several changes have been made to the ximage
       toolkit.
     * Upgraded to better adhere to XITE standard.
       
    xpyramid
    
   Fixed bug which sometimes caused crash during zooming.
   
    xregion
    
     * Can now produce histogram without crashing.
     * Made the "Send colortab" entry in the histogram application
       sensitive.
     * Using file-selector widget to get filenames.
       
  New features and bug fixes for non-visual programs
  
    addw
    
   Fixed bug (introduced in version 3.1) when bands were of pixeltype
   unsigned-byte.
   
    binarize
    
   Introduced limitation on region size to minimum of xsize and ysize of
   image.
   
    color2ascii
    
     * Should now give correct ascii result regardless of byteorder.
     * Error message if input file is not BIFF colortable. Earlier
       versions also processed BIFF images.
     * Removed option -ind.
       
    colorquant
    
     * Implemented option -c (for BIFF colortable output).
     * Added options -ct and -t (for colortable and image titles).
       
    makepseudo
    
     * Fixed usage message.
     * Temporary storage area is determined by environment variable
       TMPDIR.
     * Updated because of changes to colorquant.
       
    mct
    
     * Responds with usage message if no argument is given.
     * Changed to only store 8 bits from pixel-value, not 3x8 bits.
       
    rainbow
    
   Output pixel-values written as hexadecimal numbers.
   
    regionAnalyse
    
   Added "M" (i.e. mean) as possibility for option -if.
   
    saturmod
    
     * Can now read pixel-values in hexadecimal format.
     * Lines in colormap file can start with initial # (for comments).
       
  New features and bug fixes for toolkit, widgets and functions
  
    ximage toolkit
    
     * Fix to avoid segmentation fault when changing overlay color.
     * Changed parameters to ximage_layout().
     * Fixed bug in ximage_info().
     * Fixed bug which sometimes caused crash during zooming.
     * Added widget type MenuButton to the possibilities handled by
       ximage_layout().
     * Added manual page comments, especially on arguments to callback
       function ximage_work_fun.
       
    Image and ImageOverlay widgets
    
     * Changes because image is now a popup child of Control widget.
     * Made sure that widget is really resized fully when the window
       manager requests a resize.
     * Changed SetValues() in terms of how the widget instance variable
       "update" is set and to give return-value depending on what
       instance variables were changed.
     * Moved contents of SetValuesHook() into SetValues() (the hook
       procedure is obsolete since X11R4, though called by Xt for
       compatibility).
     * Moved UPDATE_* constants from private header-file to public
       header-file.
     * Fixed bug which sometimes caused crash during zooming.
       
    PrintColortable
    
     * Changed so that printed ascii colortable with hex-format
       pixelvalues has leading 0x, not zeros. In this way, the program
       _mct_ will determine the correct number base.
     * Fixed bug so that it now should give the same output ascii format
       for pixelvalues in colortable regardless of host byteorder.
     * Removed function argument "ind".
       
    tilde_expand
    
   Fixed bug which caused crash if filename was given as a single ~.

    biff2pnm and pnm2biff
    
   For conversion between BIFF and pbm/pgm/ppm (from the Pbmplus or
   Netpbm free software package).
   
    kMeansCluster
    
   Renamed from KmeansCluster.
   
  New features and bug fixes for X based visual programs
  
    xshow
    
   Made sure that also the color menus available from the menu-bar will
   mark current colormaps (fixed by adding translations to resource
   file).
   
    xadd, xfft, xmovie, xregion
    
   Enabled marking of current colormap and overlay colormap in Colors and
   OverlayColors menus in menubar.

     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  Version incompatibilities
  
   This version is incompatible with the previous version in the
   following areas
     * Added arguments for window name and icon name to functions
       _InformationBox_, _ConfirmationBox_, _SimpleDialog_ and
       _CreateDialog_. These arguments determine what appears in the
       window manager title field of each window (or icon).
     * Extra arguments to function _Init_color()_. This function is
       probably not used by anyone except internally by the XITE display
       programs.
       
  Documentation
  
   New version of User's Manual. Updates to several man-pages (and online
   hypertext reference manual html-pages).
   
  New features and bug fixes for X based visual programs
  
    xshow
    
     * The file-browser widgets should now work also for Suns running
       Solaris 2.x (SunOS 5.x).
     * The colortable in use for a particular image window will now be
       marked by an x next to the corresponding entry in the Colors menu.
       Likewise with the overlay colortable in use for a particular image
       window, it will be marked by an x next to the corresponding entry
       in the OverlayColors menu.
     * The above changes mean that _xshow_ now is able to keep track of
       which colortable and which overlay colortable is in use for each
       particular image window when more than one window are displayed at
       the same time. The behavior was rather confusing in the past.
     * Not really a change, just a comment about behavior related to the
       handling of colortables and overlay colortables: All image windows
       still share the same list of colortables and overlay colortables.
       This means that two images with overlays can not use the same
       colortable and at the same time different overlay colortables.
       This is because the overlay colortables are installed as part of
       the ordinary colortables. Of course, one may add an extra copy of
       one of the colortables and use a different overlay colortable with
       this copy.
     * Fixed the behavior of option -overlay. Now, each overlay given on
       the command-line will get the specified overlay colortable.
     * Enabled reading of overlay colortables when a command-line
       argument has a leading + and the remaining argument refers to a
       colortable file. This was a documented possibility already, but it
       didn't work. An overlay will get the last overlay colortable
       specified in front of it on the command-line.
     * The option -p for protection of the overlays has been fixed.
     * Fixed the option -i <chan>. This makes it possible to fork _xshow_
       from inside another program and pipe images along a specified
       channel. This was a documented possiblity already, but it didn't
       work.
     * An image overlay will now not disappear when colortable or overlay
       colortable is changed.
     * Added a "Background" overlay colortable.
     * Changed title of Overlay colortable menu, from Overlays to
       OverlayColors.
     * Changed names of some standard colortables.
       
    xregion
    
     * Removed covar push-button. It didn't do anything anyway.
     * Fixed bug which could sometimes result in the error message
       "broken pipe" and abortion on Silicon Graphics, when the
       statistics pushbutton is used.
     * Mask image command-line argument is now checked to see that it is
       of type unsigned-byte.
     * The option -p for protection of the overlays has been fixed.
     * An image overlay will now not disappear when colortable or overlay
       colortable is changed.
       
  New features and bug fixes for non-visual programs
  
    biffinfo
    
   Changed behaviour so that a usage message is given if no image is
   given on the command line (as filename or the special symbols accepted
   by Iread_image()). This is standard XITE behaviour.
   
    cdoc
    
   Improvements to LaTeX, troff and html output.
   
    statistics
    
     * Added option -a for user-decision of output format (number of
       significant digits) of integer and floating-point results.
     * Added option -h for printing horizontal header above results.
     * Fixed bugs which sometimes returned incorrect minimum and maximum
       values.
     * Minor changes to semantics for some options.
       
  New features and bug fixes for functions
  
     * statistics/statistics.c: Fixed bugs in statisticsMask which
       sometimes returned incorrect minimum and maximum values
     * Added resource XtNoverlaytab to _ImageOverlay_ Widget, to keep
       track of the overlay colortable in use.
       
  Other code changes
  
    include-directory
    
   xite_random.h: Changed declarations under IBM AIX.
   
    src-directory
    
     * ximage/xmovie.c: Renamed function usleep to avoid conflict under
       IBM AIX.
     * xshow/Xdialog.c: Added arguments for window name and icon name to
       functions InformationBox, ConfirmationBox, SimpleDialog and
       CreateDialog
     * xshow/Xcolor.c: Cleaned up in global variables and removed
       function Get_color() because keeping track of the colortable in
       use must be done by each image widget separately.
     * xshow/Xcolor.c: Added functions ColorHook() and OverlayHook() to
       handle marking of color menu entries to show present colortable
       and overlay colortable in use for each image window.
     * xshow/Xcolor.c: Fixed indexing of overlay colortables.
     * xshow/Xcolor.c: Added function Color_ovl_max().
     * xshow/Xfunc.c: Extra arguments to function Init_color().
     * matlab/saveBiff.c: Avoided error message under IBM AIX.

  Version incompatibilities
  
   This version is incompatible with the previous version in the
   following areas
     * Function _ximage_init()_ has an additional parameter _warn_. You
       should probably set this equal to zero. Setting it equal to 1
       makes the function check that the version of the X app-defaults
       file is synchronized with the version of XITE.
       
  Documentation
  
   A _reference manual_ is available in hypertext (html) format. This is
   built automatically from the man pages when you install XITE. The
   reference manual reflects the traditional man grouping into sections
   as well as the _xshow_ menu hierarchy.
   
   The reference manual can be read independently with an html reader or
   be shown from inside _xshow_. See the comments on _xshow_ below.
   
  New features and bug fixes for X based visual programs
  
    xshow
    
     * Can also display images with signed byte pixels.
     * Improved widget geometry negotiation when very narrow images are
       displayed.
     * Fixed bug which made _xshow_ crash when zooming in on images with
       very large pixelvalues (when the pixelvalues would be shown in
       ascii).
     * There used to be a lower limit on how small subimages one could
       choose with the left mouse-button as input to a program. This
       limit has now been decreased so that images consisting of more
       than one pixel may now be chosen.
     * The action of the help-button in the control window can now be
       chosen by the user. The action is to start one of a list of chosen
       help programs, such as netscape, Mosaic, lynx, man or xman.
       Choosing one of the three WWW browsers will bring up the front
       page of the XITE online hypertext reference manual. See man xshow
       for more information on this.
     * _xshow_ not only compiles and builds but now also runs under
       Linux. Tested briefly under Linux 1.2.13 on a Pentium.
       
  New features and bug fixes for non-visual programs
  
    addw
    
   Works for all pixeltypes.
   
    cdoc
    
     * Additional markup-codes introduced for manual-page comments.
     * Can also handle html format in output-files (for hypertext
       reference manual).
       
    convolve
    
   The convolution kernel can also be a BIFF image.
   
    image_minmax
    
   Works also for signed-byte images.
   
    mean
    
   Works for all non-complex pixel-types.
   
    signDiff
    
   Works for all pixeltypes.
   
    statistics
    
     * Works also for signed byte pixeltype.
     * Avoids abortion if mask size is different from band size (by
       checking for this condition).
     * Changed behaviour when no image argument is given, to echo a usage
       message (standard XITE behaviour).
       
  New features and bug fixes for toolkit
  
    ximage_init
    
   This function now has an extra parameter "warn".
   
  Other
  
    makexite
    
   Fixed bug in installation script for Linux.

     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
  Version incompatibilities
  
   This version is incompatible with the previous version in the
   following area
   
    Byte-ordering for images
    
   This version does automatic byte-swapping, as explained below in the
   section Architectures/platforms. BIFF images written with a previous
   version of XITE may give peculiar results when reading them with
   version 3.0 or higher. This will happen if an image with pixeltype
   other than unsigned byte or signed byte was written with a
   little-endian host. Examples of little-endian platforms are DecStation
   and Intel ix86, while most other platforms are big-endian.
   
   The peculiar results may be an error message like "bus error" or
   strange-looking images. Running the XITE program _statistics_(1) on
   such an image will typically give rather extreme values for Min and
   Max and the value NaN for Mean and St.dev.
   
   The solution is to explicitly perform byte-swapping on the images.
   This is done with the XITE program _byteswap_(1). Note that this is
   only necessary for multi-byte pixeltypes.
   
  Main new features
  
    Menus
    
     * A simple macro-generator for _xshow_. It generates macros from
       mouse-button activity. This minimizes mouse usage when running a
       sequence of algorithms on different images.
       The macro may optionally be appended as an entry in the menu
       hierarchy which will be updated on-the-fly.
     * Multiple menufiles are handled by _xshow_, e.g. the menufile
       supplied with the XITE distribution, one site-specific file, one
       project-specific file and a personal file. They are all linked in
       the menu hierarchy in _xshow_.
     * An expanded menu interface in _xshow_(1). Virtually all XITE
       programs are available from menu entries.
       
    Architectures/platforms
    
     * XITE also runs on 64-bit architectures (tested on Dec Alpha under
       OSF1).
     * Architectures tested include: Silicon Graphics Indy under IRIX 5,
       Sun Sparc under SunOS 4, Dec Alpha under OSF1, Pentium PC under
       Linux, IBM RS 6000 under AIX and DecStation 5000 under ULTRIX 4.
     * Automatic byte-swapping when reading BIFF images from a file with
       a foreign byte-ordering (little-endian versus big-endian).
       
    Format converters
    
     * Converters between XITE's file format BIFF and TIFF (Tag Image
       File Format) are included. See _biff2tiff(1), biff2tiff(3),
       tiff2biff(1)_ and _tiff2biff(3)_.
     * Converters between XITE's file format BIFF and MATLAB binary files
       are included. See _matlab2biff(1), matlab2biff(3), biff2matlab(1),
       biff2matlab(3)_ and the MATLAB functions _loadBiff_ and
       _saveBiff_.
     * New program _color2ascii_(1).
       
    Algorithms
    
     * Lots of new thresholding/binarization algorithms, see
       _binarize(1)_.
     * Routines and programs to extract rows, columns, cross-sections and
       lines with arbitrary inclination. See _profile(1), profile(3),
       crossSection(1), crossSection(3)_ and _vectorPeak(3)_.
       
    Colors and such
    
     * All the X11 programs now handle 24-bit color displays of visual
       types DirectColor and TrueColor, as well as 8-bit PseudoColor and
       GrayScale.
     * All the supplied colortables work for both 8-bit and 24-bit
       pixels.
     * New program _color2ascii_(1).
       
    Other changes to X user interface
    
     * New widgets (file browsers) for selecting input/output files in
       _xshow_(1).
     * X11 resources can now be set by each individual user.
     * Default X11 application resources files for the programs _xshow,
       xregion, xmovie, xfft, xadd, xhistogram_ and _xpyramid_.
     * All the X11 applications will behave gracefully when the window
       manager tries to kill a window.
     * Fixed or variable aspect ratio in _xshow_ is now local to each
       image, not a global setting. Can be controlled via menu and _xshow_
       option -aspect.
     * Each image in _xshow_ may have a menubar attached above it. Can be
       controlled via menu and _xshow_ option -mb.
       
  New features and bug fixes for X based visual programs
  
    xshow
    
     * Menus
          + A simple macro-generator which generates macros from
            mouse-button activity. This minimizes mouse usage when
            running a sequence of algorithms on different images.
            The macro may optionally be appended as an entry in the menu
            hierarchy which will be updated on-the-fly. The
            macro-generator is limited to the programs accessed via the
            control window menu button and does not record activity in
            the image menubar or image popup menus.
          + Multiple menufiles are handled, e.g. the menufile supplied
            with the XITE distribution, one site-specific file, one
            project-specific file and a personal file. They are all
            linked in the menu hierarchy.
          + An expanded menu interface. Virtually all XITE programs are
            available from menu entries.
          + Each image may have a menubar attached above it. The menubar
            gives access to the same facilities as the popup menus inside
            the image. Can be controlled via menu and option -mb.
     * Colors and such
          + Added the ability to load colortables into the slice tool,
            from file or from the corresponding image.
          + Can handle displays with 24-bit DirectColor or TrueColor as
            their default visual type, as well as 8-bit PseudoColor and
            GrayScale.
          + Made reduced-color the default at startup for 24-bit
            DirectColor.
          + Changed the setting of colormap for text widgets to be the
            default colormap of the display. Should rather use Xmu
            functions which can give colormaps for available, non-default
            visuals.
          + Checking inclusive or of color-masks when getting the list of
            available visuals. Must match what _xshow_ expects (i.e.
            0bbbbbb, where each b denotes 4 consecutive high bits).
          + Added a warning if the bits_per_rgb of the display does not
            match what _xshow_ expects.
          + Denying change of overlay colors when default colormap is in
            use.
          + Fixed a bug so that the line in the histogram widget with red
            mode is no longer blue, and vice versa.
          + Generates better names for the colortables menu entries
            referring to the colortables used by the histogram and slice
            tools.
     * Other changes to X user interface
          + Fixed or variable aspect ratio is now local to each image,
            not a global setting. Can be controlled individually via menu
            and initially via the option -aspect.
          + Fixed options for width and height of image window.
          + Added scrollbar to feedback widget.
          + Added horizontal scrollbar to textual results widget.
          + Changed flag menu entry label text form 128 colors to Reduced
            colors.
          + Changed Histogram widget button name from Hist.spec. to
            Piecewise linear.
          + Made window name (as displayed by window manager) for the
            histogram and slice windows dependent on the particular image
            name.
          + Added trailing ... to submenu entries and the ability to have
            menu separators.
     * Miscellaneous
          + Cleaned up in command-line options and usage message.
          + Added warning for "Send image" (in Histogram widget) when
            image is not unsigned byte.
          + Fixed bug to avoid some crashes when the number of widgets is
            high.
          + Added option -ver to echo XITE version number.
       
  New features and bug fixes for non-visual programs
  
    biffswap
    
     * Added byte-swapping for complex and double complex pixel types.
     * Fixed bug in byte-swapping for double pixel type.
       
    biff2ps
    
   Fixed gray level option and added more gray level choices.
   
    biff2tiff and tiff2biff
    
     * Added TIFF palette (BIFF pseudocolor) images.
     * Added several extra image/pixel type conversions.
       
    histo2ps
    
     * Removed rotation and translation code (better done by e.g. LaTeX
       or Framemaker).
     * Fixed BoundingBox.
     * Added option -ps to choose between EPSF and plain PS.
     * Added some PostScript Document Structuring comments.
       
    makepseudo
    
   New name for makergb.
   
    makergb
    
   Changed name to makepseudo.
   
    mct
    
   Made possible the use of -, -0 and -1 for file names.
   
    pixel_mapper
    
   Standard XITE file naming now works.
   
    pyramid
    
     * The ordering of the levels in the pyramid is changed. Level one is
       now the original image.
     * Gaussian pyramid is included and a switch for number of levels
       wanted.
       
    rainbow
    
   Added the outfile argument.
   
    regionAnalyse
    
   Added option -cursor.
   
    scale
    
   Special treatment for rounding of negative bytes, shorts and ints.
   
  Code improvements
  
     * All the source code has been prototyped to enable type checking of
       parameters as described by the ANSI standard. Traditional
       compilers (K&R code) can still be used, except for building the
       TIFF converters.
     * XITE now also runs on 64-bit architectures (tested on Dec Alpha
       under OSF1).
     * Platform-specific includes are handled by special header files, to
       isolate such dependencies.
     * XITE has been compiled with different compilers. Some parts (like
       the TIFF converters and the file browser widgets) may prefer an
       ANSI compiler, like the GNU compiler gcc.
       
  New tools for programmers
  
   _cxite_, a script for compiling and linking code which uses the XITE
   library and possibly X libraries.
   
  Installation etc.
  
     * An improved installation procedure in general.
     * Script for rebuilding XITE (_makexite_).
     * Utiltiy scripts to get a more automatic and robust installation
       procedure.
