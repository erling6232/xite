Known bugs in version 3.4

     * Some algorithms only work for images with pixel type UNS_BYTE.
     * Choosing send image from the histogram window works properly only
       for UNS_BYTE images.
     * Manipulation of the histogram is not reflected in the image when
       the histogram is made via the xshow menu on platforms with
       multiple hardware colormaps (such as Silicon Graphics Indy). This
       is not serious, since a histogram can also be generated from using
       the mouse button (Shift-MB2) in the image window. In this latter
       case, manipulation of the histogram is reflected.
     * The scrollbars in the slice window do not influence each other
       when the application is run on a Silicon Graphics Indy.
     * When a very narrow image is displayed, the actual image may only
       occupy a vertical strip on the left side of the window. The rest
       of the window will be shown in the window background color
       (typically gray). This happens when the following conditions are
       met.
          + The window width is smaller than the width of the window
            manager decoration (window title above the image).
          + The window is displayed with fixed aspect ratio.
       To solve this, either start _xshow_ with the option "-aspect" (to
       use variable aspect ratio) or turn off the fixed aspect ratio of
       the particular window as soon as it has come up (via a menu entry
       in the Options image menu), or remove the window manager
       decoration (see the manual page for your choice of window manager
       or look for a decoration resource in the window manager's
       application defaults file).
     * If you have problems building shared libraries on an IRIX64 host,
       add the option -check_registry /usr/lib/so_locations to the ld
       command. You can do it in the makefile for the IRIX64 platform (in
       XITE's etc directory) or with these steps:

       cd $XITE_HOME/src/Image
       make -r dso DSO_NAME_OPT='-check_registry /usr/lib64/so_locations -sonam
e'

   If XITE was compiled in platform-dependent subdirectories, replace the
       above cd command with the following

       cd $XITE_HOME/src/Image/IRIX64
